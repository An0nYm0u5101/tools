# wget is preinstalled, curl is not (normal)
# having trouble downloading the script with wget :(
#  whenever downloading over https, wget gives the error messagine `- : Unsupported scheme.`
#    this is probably an HTTPS issue, need to try `--no-check-certificate` (Didn't work)
#    the `--no-check-certificate` option is not available for the wget that ships with AIX 7.2
